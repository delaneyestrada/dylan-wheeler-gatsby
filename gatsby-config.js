    description: `The “Broke Ass Kid” Dylan Wheeler is a perfect example of what the evolution of the Texas Independent
      Music Scene looks like and the level of artist that it can produce. His music has all the
      singer-songwriter laden depth that lyric lovers covet, while his blending of both Rock and Alternative
      genres allows his original productions to feel comfortingly familiar whilst simultaneously breathing a
      gust of fresh air into a scene that has long been saturated by its Country roots.`,
